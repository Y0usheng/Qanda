for this assignment, usability improvements, i use the a straightforward layout where users are either prompted to register/login or are taken directly to their dashboard. This eliminates confusion about how to get started. And navigation between pages such as the dashboard, user profiles, and individual threads is clear and consistent, making the user experience smooth.
And the forms for login, registration, and thread creation use a simple structure that guides the user with clear input labels and buttons, error messages are displayed in popup windows when login or registration fails, providing immediate feedback on what went wrong and what needs to be corrected.
All buttons are clearly labeled to ensure users understand what action each button performs (e.g., "Login", "Register", "Back", etc.).
Buttons are grouped logically to keep related actions together, such as in the thread view where buttons like "Like", "Watch", and "Back" are aligned for easy access.
For accessibility improvements, we add the alt text for images. Profile images include alt attributes that describe the content of the image, allowing visually impaired users using screen readers to understand the purpose of the image, also i use ARIA labels where appropriate, such as associating <label> elements with form inputs through for and id attributes. This helps screen readers correctly identify the input fields.
And i use text has sufficient contrast against its background. For example, buttons use a blue color with white text to ensure readability for users with visual impairments, and background colors, borders, and text colors have been carefully selected to meet WCAG contrast ratio requirements. Also the form is good for accessibility.
